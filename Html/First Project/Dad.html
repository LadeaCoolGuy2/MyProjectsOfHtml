<h1>Christmas Poems</h1>
<li><p3> Christmas poem written by Susie M. Best
If old Kriss Kringle should forget
To travel Christmas eve,
I tell you now, I think next day
The little folks would grieve.
There wouldn’t be a single toy,
A single box or book,
And not a bit of candy in
Their stockings when they’d look
Because, you see, Kriss Kringle has
A “corner” on these things,
‘Tis he, and he alone, who in
The night our presents brings.
Then let us all try to avert
This sad catastrophe,
And hope Kriss Kringle may at least
Remember you and me.
</p3></li>
<li><p4>I Believe...
I believe that Rudolph's red nose glows
I believe that Santa sings funny jingles all through his journey
I believe that he assesses if we've been good the whole year as he sees all our doings in his magical crystal sphere
I believe that he smiles at us on the streets irrespective of whether we smile back
I believe he makes miracles happen on the 34th Street
I believe he exists.
And while some fly back to a huge lit up Christmas tree back in their city,
Some of us have to make do with some cheap glitter balls and stars and fairy lights for the tiny ones sitting on our dorm room tables
With carols and beliefs, beer and cakes, lonely mistletoes and lonelier clubs, a room full of friends and old family secrets;
On Christmas Eve, we all find a way to make ourselves feel at home
On Christmas Eve, we all find a way to be our own Santa Claus.

<h2>The true meaning of Christmas</h2>
<p5>The real meaning of christmas is god.There are many distractions
  that pull us away form the true meaning of christmas.One of the
  main resons is that people want a perfect christmas.Even tho it is impossible
  many people still try to have one and it is stressful and tiring.The worst
  part is that it costs a ton to have a normal christmas and more
    to have a better christmas.
